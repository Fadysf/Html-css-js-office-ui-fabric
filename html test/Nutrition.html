                <h3>Meal plan for men</h3>
                <p>If you're going to bulk up, lose fat, or stay healthy, 
                        you'll also need a goal-specific meal plan to get results. 
                        We've created templates to help you do all three, along 
                        with guidelines to help you track the calories, carbs, 
                        protein, and fat you should be shooting for each day.
                        
                        Stock your fridge and pantry with the foods outlined in 
                        our grocery lists to whip up delicious, nutritious meals all year. 
                        To get you started, we've also included sample recipes, plus 
                        plenty of options to swap in for added variety. This is your 
                        one-stop shop for what and how to eat in the new year.
                        
                        The composition of your meals will be determined by your 
                        goals and the timing of your weight training. The meals in 
                        our New Year's plan are divided into two categories: 
                        those with starchy carbs and those without.

                <h3>Supplements Guide</h3>
                <p>Pop open the protein section of a 20-year-old diet book. It looks nothing like today's nutrition literature! It was thought that the human body needed 10-to-15 percent of its daily caloric intake from protein, a number still propagated by official government guidelines.
                        Now, after extensive study and testing, it's commonly thought that 20-to-30 percent is a more accurate intake, especially for hard-training athletes and weekend warriors.
                        Because they've been educated by strength trainers and coaches, athletes eat high amounts of protein. Their coaches discovered what works best through decades of trial and error. Just recently has this information been absorbed by the general public.
                        The first and most obvious step to getting enough daily protein is through food - preferably through animal sources, complete proteins. This can be time-consuming and expensive.
                        Eating every 2-to-3 hours isn't possible for some people, while others just don't want to eat that frequently. That's where protein supplementation factors in.
